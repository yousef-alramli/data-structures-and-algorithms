# Stacks and Queues
using the queue and stack to add , remove nodes , knowng whats first of the the list and if I'ts empty

## Challenge
- using the queue functions like enqueue to add, dequeue to remove, peek to know the first node and isEmpty to know if its empty 
- using the stack functions like push to add, pop to remove, peek to know the first node and isEmpty to know if its empty 

## API

1. Queue methods:

    - **dequeue**: removes an element from the front of queue with an big-O of O(1) times.
    - **enqueue**: adds an element to the rear of queue with an big-O of O(1) times.
    - **peek**: returns the front value of the queue with an big-O of O(1) times. 4.isempty: returns  boolean is the queue is empty or not with an big-O of O(1) times.
    - **isEmpty**: returns a boolean, True if the queue is empty and False if the queue is not empty


1. Stack methods:

    - **pop**: removes an element from the top of stack with big-O of O(1) times.
    - **push**: adds an element to the top of stack with an big-O of O(1) times.
    - **peek**: returns the top value of the stack with an big-O of O(1) times. 4.isempty: returns boolean    is the stack is empty or not with an big-O of O(1) times.
    - **isEmpty**: returns a boolean, True if the stack is empty and False if the stack is not empty

## Approach & Efficiency
- The program is working fine all the needed got achieved  
- big-O = O(n)
