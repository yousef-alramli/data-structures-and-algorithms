# Trees


## Challenge Summary
making tress in pre order, in order, and post order 

## Approach & Efficiency
- The program is working fine all the needed got achieved  
- big-O = O(n)

## API
* **Pre_order** return an array having value in order of this depth first traversal root -> left -> right


* **Post_order** return an array having value in order of this depth first traversal left -> root -> right



* **in_order** return an array having value in order of this depth first traversal left -> right -> root



* **add** Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

* **Contains** Returns boolean to indicate if the value is in the tree at least once (True if in the tree and False if not).
